The Crosschain Project
=================================
This is the integration and staging tree for the crosschain Project, a series of
improvements and extensions to the Bitcoin protocol.

What is the Crosschain Project?
-----------------
Crosschain is an open source collaborative project where we work on a collection
of experiments to more rapidly bring technical innovation to Bitcoin.  crosschain
are features that are proposed and developed in this technical community that in
arbitrary combinations can be fashioned into sidechains.
